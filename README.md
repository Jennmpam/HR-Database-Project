# HR Database Project

This project is an HR database designed using MySQL Workbench to store and manage employee data efficiently. Please note that all data used in this database is fictional and created solely for the purpose of showcasing my coding skills. It does not represent any real-world data.

## Features
- Tables: Employees, Departments, Positions, Salaries, Leaver Requests
- Relationships to maintain data integrity
- EmployeeOverview (View) for summarised employee data
- Stored procedures for data processing and management tasks

## How to Use
1. Import `hr_database.sql` into MySQL Workbench
2. Explore the `hr_database.mwb` file for database structure
3. Run queries to explore the data
